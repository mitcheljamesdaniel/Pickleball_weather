Pickleball Weather Forecaster
-----------------------

You're probably sick of hearing it by now: pickleball is the fastest growing sport in the US. If you're part of the growing legion of pickleball players that regularly plays outdoors, you probably want a quick and convenient way to figure out when weather conditions will be suitable for pickleball. This app retrieves the 5-day weather forecast for your location, determines which times are suitable to your personal weather preferences, and presents the information in an easy-to-read weather forecast table.

I built the app UI using Shiny for Python. The code uses openweather APIs to retrieve geolocation and weather data. The app is hosted on GitHub Gist and uses Shinylive to run.

You can customize the temperature range, chance or precipitation, and max wind speed you enjoy playing in. The forecast will automatically update to reflect these changes.
